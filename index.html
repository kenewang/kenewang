            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Looking back, I've always been fascinated by technology. My first phone was a Samsung Galaxy, and shortly after
                acquiring it, I began tinkering with its applications and user interface, captivated by the possibilities. This
                initial curiosity sparked a series of events that led me to teach myself how to fix smartphones.
                Through self-directed learning, I gained in-depth knowledge of smartphone components and became proficient in
                addressing common issues. I mastered various repairs, including screen replacements and software troubleshooting,
                and developed technical skills such as disassembly and reassembly, soldering, and desoldering. As my confidence
                grew, I expanded my expertise to include computer repairs, further broadening my technical horizon.
                The potential of technology to revolutionize various aspects of life is profound, which is a major reason I chose to
                pursue a degree in Information Technology at North West University. Throughout my studies, I have honed my technical
                skills and developed a strong foundation in essential areas like effective collaboration, leadership, and
                adaptability—qualities fundamental to the field of Information Technology.
                My academic journey has been enriched by practical experiences. I have participated in numerous tech settings,
                engaged in collaborative projects, and taken on leadership roles in university. These experiences have provided me
                with a real-world perspective on the dynamic nature of technology and the importance of teamwork and leadership.
                Moreover, my ability to adapt to new technology and troubleshoot problems has been instrumental in my growth. I am
                committed to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest trends and innovations in the tech world.
